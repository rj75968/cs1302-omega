## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a friendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

The app is a JavaFX GUI implementation of the classic arcade game 'Pac-Man'. It is a simple one-level game that allows the user multiple opportunities to play. Each turn will result in a new game board being created. The user is able to contol the Pac-Man character and navigate through the game's grid to eat dots, cherries, and ghosts!

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned more about Staging and adding to the Scene. As I planned out my classes, I had to read through a lot of API to find the classes that would do what I needed. When I finally ran my app, it was nice to see everything exactly where I wanted it!

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would put together a more detailed plan for my classes. I struggled with efficiently connecting my classes. I would also add more levels for further complexity in the application.
